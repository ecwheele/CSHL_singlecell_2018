TSCC has two login nodes and you are randomly assigned one when logging into tscc. However, we need to tunnel with the same login node, so this number is important for the next step. In this example, I am on login node 1.\n",

    "**1) Submitting interactive job to obtain own node.** Because some of the packages that we will be running are somewhat memory intensive, we are going to get in the habit of obtaining an interactive node prior to opening Jupyter notebooks. This allows us to \"reserve\" nodes ahead of time and run tasks interactively without having to request compute resources on a per job basis. The following will request 1 compute nodes (4 processors) for a duration of 4 hours:\n",

If anyone else is using this number, your notebook will not load. Add the & sign at the end of the line to allow this command to \"run in the background\". Without it, you will not be able to return to the command line while running a notebook in this window.\n",
