    "Screens are a very versatile tool when working on a Unix-like command-line interphase. Screens allow you to have multiple, independent windows within the same login session (similar to tabs in a web browser). They are also capable of running continuously, even when you log off of TSCC. This is especially useful if you are running a command and happen to lose connection to the cluster or your computer crashes; as long as you are running in an active screen session, you should be able to resume without any issues!
