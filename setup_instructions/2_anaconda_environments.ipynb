    "### 4) Create a virtual environment on TSCC\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are isolated programming environments that allow users to install packages specific to individual projects, without worrying about compatability among dependency issues. For example, if you were working on **Project A** which requires Package **V1.0**, but also working on **Project B** which requires Package **V2.0**, you could create two environments and work on both without worrying about any version conflicts. We are going to be working mostly in python3 for this course, but sometimes we still need python2. So we are going to create two different envrionments which will allow you to work in either version as needed.\n",

    "There are a few ways to create virtual environments, but the easiest way for us to just use conda:\n",
